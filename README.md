## Task list

This sample project uses Laravel and React and builds a simple Todo list.

### Add styling

Use either bootstrap v4 or tailwind to style the page and component.

## Create APIs

Create a todo list API which returns the list of todos and integrate that in to the TodoList component. The API can return a static list.

## Design database

Create migration and seed an initial list of Todos. Update the API endpoint to return the todos from the database. The API should accept a search parameter and only return the todos matching the search.

## Ability to update status

Allow user to check / uncheck the done status and store it in the database. Create needed APIs for this.

## Any other improvements

Do any other improvements which you can think up.
